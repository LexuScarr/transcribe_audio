9 -  In the closet and the halls
10 -  It comes away again I can't control it
11 -  Hiding under the bed
12 -  In my body and my head
13 -  Why won't somebody come and save me from this make it end
14 -  I feel it deep within
15 -  It's just beneath the skin
16 -  I must confess that I feel like a monster
